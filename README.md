# ai-code-buddy

This is a simple ReactJS based application built to harness the power of AI. I have used the Google Gemini Pro model for this project.
To successfully run the project at your end, you will need to replace the dummy API Key in the .env file with an actual Gemini Pro key.
Once you use a proper API Key, the model should run successfully and you will be able to chat with the AI.
